Installation
============

You can install ``eda-report`` from the `Python Package Index`_ using ``pip``::

    $ pip install eda-report

You can also install the latest stable version right from the `GitHub repository`_ using::

    $ pip install https://github.com/tim-abwao/eda-report/archive/main.tar.gz

Only **Python3.7 to 3.9** are currently supported.

.. hint::
    Consider using a `virtual environment`_. Virtual environments are a great way to ensure that you install the right versions of dependencies, while avoiding breaking other Python packages in your system.
